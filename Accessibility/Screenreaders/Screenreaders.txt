Screen reader is a tool that reads your screen. Necessary for blind people, important for partially-sighted users and helpful for people with reading disorders.

How to improve your website's experience for screen readers:

1) Use aria-labels, if you have more than one type of element.

2) Write more precise information on names. For example, if an input requires you to enter zip code, label it as 'Enter zip code'

3) Do not use hidden elements to describe the title of your webpage, since there is a <title> element already.
